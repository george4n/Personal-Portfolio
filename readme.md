## Technologies

### Project Structure

```

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/[username]/personal-portfolio.git
cd personal-portfolio
```

2. **Install the dependencies**

```
npm install
```

3. **Run the development server**

```
npm start
```

This will compile the SASS, copy assets and html files, and start a live-reload dev server using Browsersync.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, use:

```
npm run build

This will compile and minimise the styles, autoprefix, and copy necessary files.
